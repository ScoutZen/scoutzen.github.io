Managing a social media presence may require many people on your team to work
together, coordinating on tasks and strategies to connect with your community.
But, you may draw the line at sharing the Twitter account itself. ScoutZen Teams
makes balancing these concerns a little bit easier, allowing you to invite
others to join your ScoutZen account with their own ScoutZen login. Team members
can view scouts,  Scout activity and export scout results. While as an account
owner, you retain full administrative and billing control.

## Get more done with Teams

Just like any other team, you can be more productive with ScoutZen teams by
working together on tasks and sharing the load. Put team members to work
gathering Scout result data, analyzing it and integrating it them with your
other tools.

## Improve security with Teams

With TeamSnap Teams, both your Twitter and ScoutZen accounts become more secure.
On the Twitter side, you can now keep your Twitter username and password to
yourself and avoid sharing them with other team members when you want them to
access your ScoutZen account. If your business engages with contractors,
consultants or agencies to help manage your social media presence, you may not
be comfortable letting them have full access to the Twitter account in order to
login to ScoutZen. ScoutZen team members login with their own email address to
access Scout results.

For your ScoutZen account, team members can access scout activity and results,
but they do not have access to modify your scouts, billing information or other
account settings.

## Building your Team

To get started adding members, visit your Settings page and click on the Members
section. Fill out the invite member form and you'll be able to track their
status at any time by returning to the Members page.

Here's a walkthrough of the process:

## Using ScoutZen as a team Member

After being added to the team, your new members will be able to work with the
Scouts you've created, but first they need to login. Your team members will
login with their own email address and password, rather than login with the
Twitter account you used when creating your ScoutZen account.
