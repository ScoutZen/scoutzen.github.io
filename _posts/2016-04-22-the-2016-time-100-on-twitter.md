Time Magazine published its annual list of [The 100 Most Influential People](http://time.com/collection/2016-time-100/)
yesterday, presenting a list with a mix of household names and newly discovered
people which you may not have heard of.

The first question I had was: How many of the the 100 go to Twitter when they
have something to say? You may remember Fred Wilson’s post back in February,
[about the The Twitter Contradiction](http://avc.com/2016/02/the-twitter-contradiction/)
and this list is a compelling test case for his contention that:

> Twitter is where people who have something to say go to say it.

The second question I had was: Is there a Twitter List for this list? There is
now with the [Twitter List](https://twitter.com/scoutzen/lists/time-100-most-influential)
we’ve built for this year’s Time 100 class. Go subscribe to easily stay up to
date on what this class is talking about.

#### A quick analysis

With the Twitter List setup, we can use some of the tools we’re building to
analyze The Time 100 Twitter profiles.

Out of the 100, 69 of them are on Twitter. That could be debatable with some
accounts that may not really be that person. And, similarly, many of the
accounts are run by staff, not the person themselves. But, 2/3 presence on
Twitter is a pretty good start. 49 of the 69 are currently verified. It appears
The Verified account team at Twitter has some work to do today.

On the other hand, you may find it a relief that nearly a third of the Time 100
class of influencers are not on Twitter. Based on this fact, people that are
working hard, doing great things but have not jumped into social media can
likely feel no obligation to do so.

After exporting into a spreadsheet, we can get some aggregate stats on the
group.

* Exported List of Time 100’s Twitter Profiles
* Median Followers: 596,584
* Median Friends: 348
* Median Tweets: 3602
* Median number of Twitter Lists on: 3776

#### Popularity contest for the popularity contest

It should come as no surprise that entertainers, politicians, journalists and
athletes have a significant Twitter presence. The top 10 most followed on this
list are:

1. [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama)
2. [@ArianaGrande](https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande)
3. [@Adele](https://twitter.com/Adele)
4. [@NICKIMINAJ](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ)
5. [@LeoDiCaprio](https://twitter.com/LeoDiCaprio)
6. [@priyankachopra](https://twitter.com/priyankachopra)
7. [@azizansari](https://twitter.com/azizansari)
8. [@TheRock](https://twitter.com/TheRock)
9. [@Pontifex](https://twitter.com/Pontifex)
10. [@RT_Erdogan](https://twitter.com/RT_Erdogan)

Guo Pei, a Chinese fashion designer has the fewest.

#### Early Adopter in Chief

President Obama also leads the way as an early adopter, having joined Twitter
the earliest of all of those on in the list, back in March 2007 while Human
Rights Activist Nadia Murad joined this past December and has the newest Twitter
account.

#### Tweet, Tweet

Ariana Grande’s account is the chattiest of the bunch. But, Lin-Manuel Miranda,
Nicki Minaj and Donald Trump have also tweeted over 30,000 times and are not far
behind.

#### Is Tweeting hazardous to your influence or even career?

Here’s a quick rundown of those without a Twitter presence. They tend to fall
into a few categories: military/security, foreign government officials, artists
and scientists and Twitter competitors. I can imagine that Twitter could be
viewed as a security risk in some of these circles. But for artists and
scientists, it is interesting to see them opt-out, are they focused on their
work more than others?

Dan Carder  
Marc Edwards  
Kathy Niakan  
Kip Thorne  
Yuri Milner  
Mohammed bin Nayef

Sean MacFarland  
Jin Liqun  
Angela Merkel  
Marilynne Robinson  
Alejandro González Iñárritu  
Tu Youyou  

#### Most likely to follow you

These Influential people have the highest follow-back ratio, so if you’d like to
connect on Twitter with one, these are your best chances:

1. [@AgenziaH](https://www.twitter.com/AgenziaH)
2. [@RidingShotgunLA](https://www.twitter.com/RidingShotgunLA)
3. [@rajpanjabi](https://www.twitter.com/rajpanjabi)
4. [@JahaENDFGM](https://www.twitter.com/JahaENDFGM)
5. [@LeeRberger](https://www.twitter.com/LeeRberger)

On the other side, there’s very little chance of @azizansari following you since
the “Pasta Lover” currently follows 0 people.

#### About those Twitter Lists

Ironically, looking back at the [Twitter Lists launch](https://blog.twitter.com/2009/theres-a-list-for-that),
Time was mentioned in the lead of the post. Twitter Lists have long been one of
those features that many Twitter fans love and find incredibly useful, yet
Twitter invests very little in the lists feature.

analysis is of interest, we invite you to sign up for [ScoutZen](https://www.scoutzen.com/)
