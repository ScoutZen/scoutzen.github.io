## Get more done with shared access 

Just like any other team, you can be more productive with ScoutZen by
dividing up tasks and sharing the load. Team members can help in exploring
scout results, analyzing activity for insights or integrating data with
other tools. Others can set up new scouts as needs evolve. It also
becomes easy to manage a large number of active scouts and campaigns by
partitioning responsibility amongst team members.

## Improved security and peace of mind

Keep your Twitter and ScoutZen accounts more secure. You never have to share
passwords with others. With their own login and password management, you
will not even have to respond to queries for resetting forgotten
passwords. It can all be done directly by your associates within ScoutZen
using their own email address.

Team members who are not owners can view scout activity and results,
but they do not permissions to modify scouts, access billing information
or update other account settings.

Whether you engage with contractors, consultants or freelancers,
ScoutZen teams makes it easy to grant access, restrict roles and when
required, remove members from the team.

## Inviting your team

To get started adding members, visit your Settings page and click on the Members
section. Fill out the invite member form and we will send them an email with 
instructions to join your team on ScoutZen. You will also be able to track their
status at any time by returning to the Members page.

Here's a walkthrough of the process:
