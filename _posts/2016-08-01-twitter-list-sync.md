ScoutZen now lets you sync your scout results to Twitter lists. If you
are on a paid plan, [sign in to ScoutZen][sz] and set it up now. If you
are on the Free plan, don't worry. Just go to your [Account settings][acct]
and change plans to try out sync features __absolutely FREE for 14 days__.

Read on for more details.

Scouts run continually gathering results matching your criteria. These
results can always be browsed from within ScoutZen. However, by syncing
them to Twitter you can see the list timeline in your favorite Twitter
client. Here is how the Sync setup looks like if you go to the Settings
tab for your selected Scout.  

![Sync Setup](/assets/sync-twitter-list-setup.png)

* Provide the Twitter list name to sync to
* Select the sync criteria, including the maximum number of results
* Choose if you want the Twitter list to be public or private
* Check "Enable Sync" to get the sync running

### Twitter List Creation

If the Twitter list with the name you provide does not exist, ScoutZen
will create it with the appropriate public or private setting you
specify. If the list already exists, ScoutZen will keep it in sync based
on the sync conditions you specify.

__IMPORTANT! The sync is one-way only.__ The Twitter list is kept in sync
with the Scout results. Any items or changes to the Twitter list may not
be retained unless they are part of the Scout results and meet the sync
conditions.

### Sync Selection

Twitter lists can have no more than 5000 members. However, it is
very easy to have scouts gathering tens of thousands of results. For
example, when a Scout is tracking followers of some account, or monitoring
a very popular hashtag. Sync conditions help you get the best results
while staying under the limit of Twitter list members.

Simply specify the maximum number (upto 5000) sorted by descending
number of:

* Followers
* Friends
* List memberships
* Tweets
* Recent Activity

Scout results will be sorted to gather the appropriate candidates
for syncing with the Twitter list.

### FAQ & Technical Details

1. Every Scout can sync to its own Twitter list. As long as you are on
   the paid plan (or trialing it).
1. Each Scout can sync to just own Twitter list at a time. You can
   always change the Twitter list it syncs to.
1. The sync is subject to [Twitter API rate limits][twrl], including
   unpublished throttling.
1. A large initial sync might take several days to sync up. Incremental
   changes should be kept in sync on a daily basis.

So try it out, and [let us know][mail] if any questions or feedback.

As you can imagine, in addition to accomodating Twitter list membership
limits, sync selection can efficiently enable other use cases for your
marketing and outreach. We will be detailing some of these soon. So stay
posted on more news and tips from ScoutZen.
