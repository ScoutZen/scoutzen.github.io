Twitter lists are a great mechanism for discovering social communities
and engaging with prospective followers. Industry insiders and
influencers have created tens of thousands of public lists to enhance
their Twitter presence.

[__Use them to your advantage with ScoutZen__][szlp].

Read on to learn more.

## Twitter Lists - A Primer

Twitter lists allow you to curate a group of Twitter users. You can
then see a stream of tweets from those users on the list timeline.
Anyone with a Twitter account can create upto 1,000 lists, each of which
can have a maximum of 5,000 members per list.

Lists are a great way to read tweets from a select set of people. They
are particularly useful to create an alternate timeline without
following users. Even if you are following them, its useful to organize
users into lists by topics or interests for convenience and efficiency.

A Twitter list can be either public or private. Public lists can be
viewed or subscribed to by anyone. If you are added as a member to a
public list, you will get notified via Twitter. This allows you to be
aware of the list, understand its contents and check out the membership.

What if you could search by members by keywords in their bios?
Would you like to know when competitors add new members to their list?
How about building your own spreadsheet with data from multiple lists?

Here are [details on creating and using Twitter lists][twhelp] from various
clients and devices.

## Benefits of Twitter Lists

Twitter lists can provide multiple benefits for a wide range of
purposes.

As an organization mechanism, you can use Twitter lists to maintain
groups of people by their interests, industry involvement or your
personal categorization scheme. These lists and the associated timelines
are __seamlessly accessible__ from the desktop and all your devices for
on-the-go usage.

Segmenting Twitter users into lists can help you be more __efficient and
productive__. For example, you can keep up with important list of people
daily to ensure you never miss their tweets amidst the bustle of your
general timeline. At the same time, other lists can be checked once
a week, or less frequently as needed.

Adding a member to a list is an act of curation. You are signaling to
the world that you consider that set of Twitter user as key contributors
or experts in the topic which the list is intended to reflect.
Naturally, Twitter notifies users when they are added as list members.
This __encourages interaction and reciprocation__.

Within a company or agency, Twitter lists can be used to help with marketing
campaigns. This makes it easy to build and maintain __tailored audiences__
based on a variety of criteria. This can benefit in terms of better engagement
via Twitter Ads or other promotional efforts.

Public lists on Twitter are a great way to __discover communities and
gauge influencers__. You can start with well-crafted, highly subscribed
lists to find key members. Or you can view list memberships for a
particular Twitter user, optionally considering the profiles of those
who listed them.

## Twitter Lists - Use Cases

As you can imagine, given the benefits, there are innumerable uses for
Twitter lists. Below is just a small sample of how you can use Twitter
lists:

* Never miss tweets from colleagues or clients. Scan important list
  timelines and catch up quickly as part of your work flow.
* Monitor your competitors' tweets using a private list. This lets you
  track their activites through the list timeline without "following" them.
* Connect with other attendees and speakers before getting to a
  conference. Especially useful to plan when re-attending next year.
* Get the important news stories directly from respected institutions or
  people and journalists on the ground.
* Build a list of people for outreach: bloggers, industry leaders, brand
  managers, digital influencers, etc.
* Pay it forward by recommending people you know for specific skills or
  roles, either in a particular city or globally.
