Continue on to get all the details. 

## The Basics of Twitter Advanced Search

Twitter provides multiple avenues for search. The search bar on the mobile
app or website, or the [simple web search page][search-home] are great for
quickly looking up certain keywords, topics or hashtags. However, as
this [how-to from Twitter's Small Business Marketing Team
describes][howto], Advanced Search offers a lot more: 

> You could see every Tweet from today, by someone in your city (or another
> location), with the phrase “what should I have for dinner?”. You could
> filter to see everything a particular account (maybe your competitor)
> Tweeted in October. You could find a Tweet by remembering a phrase in
> it — even if you forgot who Tweeted it. You could find all the users
> who have “fashionista” in their bios and so much more.

### Search Parameters

As you can see in the screenshot above, there are numerous options and
parameters to fine-tune what you are looking for by words, people,
places, dates and sentiment:

1. Matching all of these words
1. With this exact phrase
1. Contains any of these words
1. Containes none of these words
1. Includes these hashtags
1. Written in a particular language
1. From these accounts
1. To these accounts
1. Mentioning these accounts
1. Near this place
1. Within this date range
1. Tone: Positive, Negative, Question?

### Search Operators

* from:om filter:links
* filter:-links
* filter:images

Exclusions come in handy when your terms can be used in varying contexts – you might want to look up mentions of “shades” for example, in the context of sunglasses, but you do that search and you’re going to be inundated with “50 Shades of Gray” mentions. For this, you might exclude the terms “50” and “gray”, giving you a much more relevant list.
