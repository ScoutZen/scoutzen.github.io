effectively.

Continue on to get all the details. 

## The Basics of Twitter Advanced Search

Twitter provides multiple avenues for search. The search bar on the mobile
app or website, or the [simple web search page][search-home] are great for
quickly looking up certain keywords, topics or hashtags. However, as
this [how-to from Twitter's Small Business Marketing Team
describes][howto], Advanced Search offers a lot more: 

> You could see every Tweet from today, by someone in your city (or another
> location), with the phrase “what should I have for dinner?”. You could
> filter to see everything a particular account (maybe your competitor)
> Tweeted in October. You could find a Tweet by remembering a phrase in
> it — even if you forgot who Tweeted it. You could find all the users
> who have “fashionista” in their bios and so much more.

### Search Parameters

![Advanced Search Fields](/assets/advanced-search-fields.png)

As you can see in the screenshot above, there are numerous options and
parameters to fine-tune what you are looking for by words, people,
places, dates and sentiment, to find tweets:

1. Containing all given words in any position
1. Containing exact phrases
1. Containing any of the given words
1. Excluding specific words
1. With specific hashtags
1. Written in a specific language
1. From particular accounts
1. Sent as replies to particular accounts
1. Mentioning these accounts
1. Near this place (e.g. city, state, country)
1. Within a specific date range
1. Tone: Positive, Negative, Question?

By combining fields, a search can be highly customized for any purpose.

### Search Operators

Twitter also provides convenient search operators which allow the search
parameters described above to be specified as simple text. Search
operators make Advanced Search universally available through uniform
text queries.

* The default it to search for all words.
* Use quotes to specify exact phrases, e.g. <b>"</b>digital marketing<b>"</b>
* Use OR to ask for any of the words, e.g. sales __OR__ marketing
* Use Exclude specific words with __-__, management <b>-</b>risk
* Specify hashtags as <b>#</b>usual
* Sent from or to a person, e.g <b>from:</b>om, <b>to:</b>pmarca

* Sent from a particular place, e.g. <b>near:</b>London <b>within:</b>25mi
* Date range, e.g. <b>since:</b>2017-01-01 <b>until:</b>2017-01-31
* Sentiment - positive <b>:)</b>, negative <b>:(</b>, question __?__

Using search operators, you can make the context unambiguous and the
results more relevant. 

## Automating Twitter Search

You can always do ad-hoc, one-off searches on Twitter using Advanced
Search parameters and operators described above. [Ash Read][ashread]
at Buffer outlines [two dozen different ways to use Advanced Search][buffer]
for marketing and sales, and is an excellent guide (even if you are not
a Superhuman :)

For busy mortals, however, automation is the saving grace.

[Daniel Knowlton][dknowlton1] has a great article on [automating the discovery
of leads][sme-leads]. In addition to step-by-step instructions on using
[IFTTT][ifttt] to get email notification for search results, he also outlines
smart strategies for search and engagement.

If your company uses Zapier, you can set up automation to [send new search
results to your inbox, phone, Slack or HipChat][zapier].

ScoutZen automates the search by gathering people with matching tweets
and building lists. You can think of it as a long-running search to
drive your campaigns and gather insights for promotions. In the next two
sections, we will describe how to set up and use scouts to help with your
goals.

## ScoutZen and Advanced Search

ScoutZen will accept and apply any of these search operators within
the criteria input field. It also lets you auto-complete a city and
provide the radius in lieu of entering __near:__ and __within:__
operators.

[![Scout for people with Advanced Search](/assets/scout-advanced-search.png)][szlp]

Once the scout is created, it will start running. Depending on the
search criteria, you may get results within a few minutes. 

ScoutZen will continue running the scout, gathering results to automatically
find people matching the criteria. You can then [explore, filter and sort the
results][search-sort] and export all or a subset of them to CSV.

While exploring the results, you can identify and remove from
consideration specific people matches. This is functionally equivalent
to an opt-out, ignore or block list. For example, you can remove affiliated
Twitter accounts, or those of competitors, so as to simplify post-export
usage. Profiles removed from consideration will not show up regardless
of their future activity matching the scout criteria.

The exported CSV file contains detailed profile information which can be
opened and viewed in Excel or uploaded to Google Sheets. Needless to
say, you can also combine results from multiple scouts into a single
campaign-specific spreadsheet. As you can imagine, these can form the
basis of effective campaigns including [tailored audiences][tailored]
for highly relevant Twitter Ads.

## Nifty Ways to Apply Advanced Search

Now that we have covered the mechanics of settings up scouts using
Advanced Search, let us highlight some useful applications which can
benefit your marketing efforts.

It is important to keep in mind that tweets are conversations, not
documents or blog posts, obviously. For best search results, your keywords
and phrases should reflect the manner in which people talk to each other.

### 1. People sharing your content.

Gather all the people who share your blog posts and articles or
reference you in their tweets.

[![Scout for people sharing your content](/assets/scout-examples/sharing-content.png)][szlp]

People mentioning you in their tweets or sharing your content are
already engaged with you. With ScoutZen, it is easy to maintain an
ongoing list of your fans.

### 2. People sharing articles on certain topics

Find bloggers or authors who post content about topics you care about. In
addition to learning from things they share, you can use the list to
reach out in the future with your thoughts and contributions.

[![Scout for people sharing topical content](/assets/scout-examples/with-content.png)][szlp]

### 3. People sharing a particular article

Let's say we want to know all the people who shared this particular
article. We can be very specific by searching for the link. Or we can
broaden it smartly to build a more useful list of people.

[![Scout for people sharing a link](/assets/scout-examples/link-search.png)][szlp]

### 4. People mentioning you or your industry peers

It's obvious how to find people mentioning one account. But did you know
how easy it is to find people mentioning any of a slew of companies or
products? Just OR them all.

[![Scout for people mentioning](/assets/scout-examples/or-mentions.png)][szlp]

### 5. People NOT mentioning your competition

If someone is talking about a topic without mentioning any of your
competitors, your chances at engagement and conversion are likely
higher. It's easy to do that by specifying keywords or phrases while
excluding product or company names.

[![Scout for people not mentioning](/assets/scout-examples/not-mentions.png)][szlp]

### 5. People unhappy with a product

In addition to monitoring your brand, you can also keep an eye out on
how customers are talking about your competitors. Simply include the
sentiment operators, along with product names or company handles. If you
want to be specific, you can use the __to:__ operator to look for people
responding directly to a particular account.

[![Scout for people unhappy with a product](/assets/scout-examples/product-unhappy.png)][szlp]

If done right, not only can this list drive engagement and conversion,
you are also likely to get ideas for new features and product
improvement.

Don't overlook the question __?__ sentiment. This can lead to people
having questions about how to achieve a particular goal within a
product. You might be able to help them or provide them with a better
alternative.

### 6. People sharing videos

Let's say you provide video editing services and would like to reach out
to people creating or sharing informational videos. Or if you want to
make a list of companies putting out a screencast. It's easy enough with
the __filter:videos__ operator.

[![Scout for people sharing videos](/assets/scout-examples/video-guides.png)][szlp]

Don't forget the equivalent __filter:images__  if you care about
pictures and infographics.

### 7. People talking about you in a city

ScoutZen makes it particularly easy to find people talking about your
brand in a certain location. The auto-suggest city picker eliminates
guesswork in geo-names or tedious lat-long input. Simply pick the right
city, specify the geographic coverage (e.g. 15 mi or 25km) and your
search will be focused on that area.

[![Scout for people near place](/assets/scout-examples/near-place.png)][szlp]

### 8. People signaling intent to buy

You can create your own search templates specific to your product or
niche in order to discover great opportunities and develop outreach. For
example, "anyone recommend" OR "any advice" OR "need something" are good
phrases to consider. These could be used in conjunction with any of the
examples illustrated so far.

### What's Next

Those are just a few ideas for scouts you can use today to gather
people, build lists and drive campaigns. Do you have any neat search
tricks? We would love to hear them.
