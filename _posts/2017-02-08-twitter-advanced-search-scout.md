Twitter provides a comprehensive set of search parameters to find
very specific content. Using [Advanced Search][tw-search], results can

effectively.

[__Run Twitter Advanced Search 24/7 with ScoutZen__][szlp].

Continue on to get all the details. 

## The Basics of Twitter Advanced Search

Twitter provides multiple avenues for search. The search bar on the mobile
app or website, or the [simple web search page][search-home] are great for
quickly looking up certain keywords, topics or hashtags. However, as
this [how-to from Twitter's Small Business Marketing Team
describes][howto], Advanced Search offers a lot more: 

> You could see every Tweet from today, by someone in your city (or another
> location), with the phrase “what should I have for dinner?”. You could
> filter to see everything a particular account (maybe your competitor)
> Tweeted in October. You could find a Tweet by remembering a phrase in
> it — even if you forgot who Tweeted it. You could find all the users
> who have “fashionista” in their bios and so much more.

### Search Parameters

![Advanced Search Fields](/assets/advanced-search-fields.png)

As you can see in the screenshot above, there are numerous options and
parameters to fine-tune what you are looking for by words, people,
places, dates and sentiment, to find tweets:

1. Containing all given words in any position
1. Containing exact phrases
1. Containing any of the given words
1. Excluding specific words
1. With specific hashtags

By combining fields, a search can be customized in flexible ways. 

### Search Operators

Twitter also provides convenient search operators which allow the search
parameters described above to be specified as simple text. Search
operators make Advanced Search universally available through uniform
text queries.

* The default it to search for all words.
* Use quotes to specify exact phrases, e.g. <b>"</b>digital marketing<b>"</b>
* Use OR to ask for any of the words, e.g. sales __OR__ marketing
* Use Exclude specific words with __-__, management <b>-</b>risk
* Specify hashtags as <b>#</b>usual
* Sent from or to a person, e.g <b>from:</b>om, <b>to:</b>pmarca
* Mentioning an account, e.g. <b>@</b>scoutzen
* Sent from a particular place, e.g. <b>near:</b>London <b>within:</b>25mi
* Date range, e.g. <b>since:</b>2017-01-01 <b>until:</b>2017-01-31
* Sentiment - positive <b>:)</b>, negative <b>:(</b>, question __?__
* Containing links, __filter:links__

* Containing images, __filter:images__
* Containing videos, __filter:videos__
* Having a minimum number of retweets, <b>min_retweets:</b>10
* Having a minimum number of favorites, <b>min_faves:</b>5

Using search operators, you can make the context unambiguous and the
results more relevant. 

## ScoutZen and Advanced Search

ScoutZen will accept and apply any of these search operators within
the criteria input field. It also lets you auto-complete a city and
provide the radius in lieu of entering __near:__ and __within:__
operators.

[![Scout for people with Advanced Search](/assets/scout-advanced-search.png)][szlp]

Once the scout is created, it will start running. Depending on the
search criteria, you may get results within a few minutes. 

ScoutZen will continue running the scout, gathering results to automatically
find people matching the criteria. You can then [explore, filter and sort the
results][search-sort] and export all or a subset of them to CSV.

While exploring the results, you can identify and remove from
consideration specific people matches. This is functionally equivalent
to an opt-out, ignore or block list. For example, you can remove affiliated
Twitter accounts, or those of competitors, so as to simplify post-export
usage. Profiles removed from consideration will not show up regardless
of their future activity matching the scout criteria.

The exported CSV file contains detailed profile information which can be
opened and viewed in Excel or uploaded to Google Sheets. Needless to
say, you can also combine results from multiple scouts into a single
campaign-specific spreadsheet. As you can imagine, these can form the
basis of effective campaigns including [tailored audiences][tailored]
for highly relevant Twitter Ads.

## Nifty Ways to Apply Advanced Search

Now that we have covered the mechanics of settings up scouts using
Advanced Search, let us highlight some useful applications which can
benefit your marketing efforts.

It is important to keep in mind that tweets are conversations, not
documents or blog posts, obviously. For best search results, your keywords
and phrases should reflect the manner in which people talk to each other.

### 1. Gather people sharing your content.

People replying to your tweets, mentioning you in their tweets or
sharing your content are already engaged with you. With ScoutZen, it
is easy to maintain an ongoing list of your fans.

### 1. People you have interacted with
makes it easy to gather all 
Saved searches can be great to keep an eye on people sharing your content, keywords relevant to your brand and your own mentions.

It can be hard to recall all of your interactions with another person on Twitter. As a way to refresh your mind, you can use the ‘From these accounts’ and ‘To these accounts’ filters.

Find the most popular Tweets about a topic, or competitor's tweets
gaining traction

Find ideas for blog posts
Twitter is a great source of inspiration for blog posts. When researching a post, Advanced Search is a great way to see what people are talking about relating to subject.

Find great blog posts
If you’re looking to find some great blog posts or content on a certain subject, Twitter Advanced Search can be a great way to unearth some real gems.

In the search fields you can add your chosen topic to the ‘All of these words’ field and then add ‘http’ to ‘This Exact phrase’.

Find content shared by selected accounts
For example, if you would like to see how all of your favorite tweeters are reacting to some news, search for a keyword and their names.

If you’re looking to find people who are talking about your brand in a certain location, head down to the Places section of Advanced Search and look up the areas you’d like to focus on.
This feature can be extra useful if you pair the search with a couple of keywords. For example: ‘@Buffer buffer.com near:”London, England” within:15mi’

Monitor mentions of your company
Using Twitter’s Advanced Search to monitor your brand can be extremely effective. As well as monitoring mentions of your brand name, Advanced Search allows you to keep an eye on mentions of your Twitter handle and even any Tweets that include your URL.
Here’s a search we use for all things Buffer: @buffer buffer.com

Filter out competitor Tweets
If you want to filter out any results mentioning competitors of yours, you can do so by adding their username and URL in the “None of these words” Advanced Search field.


Find happy and un-happy customers
Twitter search is a great way to quickly see a snapshot of how happy (or un-happy) your customers are.
These types of searches will help you stumble upon some great feedback and ideas too. For example, a Tweet where a customer expresses frustration could spark discussion around how you could improve your product or service.
To include sentiment filters in your search, tick the relevant box over on the Advanced Search page or simply add a happy or un-happy emoticon to the end of your search term, e.g. “buffer :(” or “buffer :)”.

Monitor sentiment about competitors
Similarly to how you can monitor sentiment about your own brand, Twitter Advanced Search gives you the power to keep tabs on how customers are talking about your competitors too.
In order to check out what people are saying about competitors, add their company name and URL to the ‘All of these words’ bar.

Search your competitor’s tweets
This is a great tip I picked up from Tim Baran. Using Advanced Search you can filter through tweets from any account and for selected keywords. To do this, simply use the ‘All of these words’ and ‘From these accounts’ fields.
Here’s an example that will show all of the times our Buffer Twitter account has mentioned ‘transparency’.
from:buffer “transparency” 

See Results for Only the People You Follow
The Twitter world moves fast and sometimes it can be easy to miss great content from the people you follow.
Thankfully, Twitter search allows you to filter Tweets from only people you follow. This, coupled with is a great way to make sure you don’t miss anything from your favorite tweeters on the subjects you care about.
Here’s an example search I used to see who from the people I follow had been talking about content marketing:

Find video related to a topic
Video is such an awesome way to bring content to life and if you’re in search of a video on a specific topic, Twitter search provides a great alternative to YouTube Search. To filter videos search using either Advanced search or toolbar search the and then select Videos from the results page filters.

 View questions only
If you tick the ‘Question ?’ box on the Advanced Search page you will only be shown results that are questions. This is a real neat trick if you do a lot of your customer support over Twitter.

Look for buying signals
Listening is extremely important in social media and by keeping an eye on what people are saying, you can find some exciting opportunities.
Searching for terms like ‘anyone recommend’ or ‘any advice on’ are really great ways to identify people with on the lookout for some help and advice.
Also keep an eye out for any buying signals shown on Twitter (for example, dissatisfaction with a competitor or showing a need your product can fulfil) and engage to get the sales cycle in motion. Try not to be too “salesy” and more conversational at this stage. Or, if you can spot someone who is looking to make a purchase imminently, jump in and get on their radar.

Think about what potential leads might tweet if they have a need or problem that your business can fulfill or solve. Here are some examples:

Tweets that ask for a recommended supplier in a specific location.
Problem tweets: A broken phone, broken fence, delayed train.
Goal tweets: Lose weight, start a business, get a new job.
Need and want tweets: Need a drink, need food, want a new car.
Feeling tweets: Stressed, upset, tired, thankful, in love.
Once you have a list of tweet ideas, start testing searches for those ideas. For example, if you’re a tour guide in London looking for potential leads, you could enter “recommend tour London” into the All of These Words field and select the Question check box.

Use the templates below to start your search query research:

“Recommend [YOUR BUSINESS TYPE] [TARGET MARKET LOCATION] ?”
“Broken [SOMETHING YOUR BUSINESS FIXES] [TARGET MARKET LOCATION] ?”
“[GOAL YOUR BUSINESS HELPS ACHIEVE] near:[TARGET MARKET LOCATION]”
“Need [PRODUCT YOUR BUSINESS SELLS] near:[TARGET MARKET LOCATION]’
“Want [PRODUCT YOUR BUSINESS SELLS] near:[TARGET MARKET LOCATION]”
“[ENTER A NEGATIVE FEELING YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE COMBATS] near:[ENTER TARGET MARKET LOCATION]”
